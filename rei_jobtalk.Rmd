### Mixed-effects Ordered Logistic Regression Models
- Ordered dependent variable (4 categories of self-rated health: poor, fair, good, very good)  
  - Brant tests indicates no violation of the parallel regression assumption (i.e., ordered relationship exists between IVs and DV).
- Random intercept models with 4 levels of data (prefecture, community, household, individual)
  - Likelihood-ratio tests indicate that  four-level models are preferred over the three-level and two-level models. 
  - These models account for the nested/clustered structure of the data. 

**Variance Components Model**
- Intraclass Correlation Coeficient (ICC) = .05   
  - Individuals' self-rated health within prefectures are not much more similar to each other than to individuals in other prefectures.

For each SD increase in Muslims sites per 10k, there is a .015 increase in probability of having **poor** health and a .011 decrease in probability of having **very good** health (both *p* < .10).  

For each SD increase in Daoist sites per 10k, there is a .019 increase in probability of having **very good** health and a .022 decrease in probability of having **poor** health (both *p* < .05).

### Preliminary Conclusions

Increased concentration of Muslim sites in Chinese prefectures is associated with lower levels of self-rated health among older Chinese adults. 

Increased concentration of Daoist sites in Chinese prefectures is associated with higher levels of self-rated health among older Chinese adults. 

No evidence that the concentration of Buddhist, Protestant, or Catholic sites is associated with self-rated health among older Chinese adults.

### Future Analyses
- Additional measures of health for older adults in CHARLS
  - Scales of functional limitations: Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) & Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)
  - Count of Chronic Illnesses
  
- Different effects by individual religious affiliation?
  - Data limitations: only 8.5% report affiliation (5.8% are Buddhist)

- Mediation analyses to test explanatory mechanisms and social pathways that link these associations (i.e., social support, social participation, health behaviors).

- Spatial dependencies?
