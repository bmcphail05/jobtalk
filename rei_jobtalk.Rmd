##.center[Research Questions]

### Study 2. How is the religious environment associated with the individual physical health outcomes of older Chinese adults?

- How is the overall presence of religion in Chinese prefectures associated with the physical health of older Chinese adults? 

- Or does the association vary by the presence of Buddhism, Catholicism, Daoism, Islam, and Protestantism?

- Does the association vary between adherents and non-adherents of each religion?

## Models
**.large[Multi-level Multinomial Logistic Regression]**
- Four ordered categories of self-rated health (poor, fair, good, very good), but violation of parallel regression assumption (i.e., ordered relationship between IVs and DV). 
- Random intercept models with 4 levels of data (prefecture, community, household, individual)
  - Likelihood-ratio tests indicate that four-level models fit better than three-level and two-level models. 
  - Account for the nested/clustered structure of the data.

For each SD increase in Muslims sites per 10k, there is a .015 increase in probability of having **poor** health and a .011 decrease in probability of having **very good** health (both *p* < .10).  

For each SD increase in Daoist sites per 10k, there is a .019 increase in probability of having **very good** health and a .022 decrease in probability of having **poor** health (both *p* < .05).

## Conclusions

No evidence that greater presence of overall religion in Chinese prefectures is associated with self-rated health among older Chinese adults.
  - Total number of religious sites has no change on probabilities of being in each self-rated health category.
  - Suggests there is not an overall effect of the "religious" environment.

## Conclusions
Greater presence of Daoism and Protestantism in Chinese prefectures is associated with **better** self-rated health among older Chinese adults. 
- Daoism: decreased probability of Poor, increased probability of Good 
- Protestantism: decreased probability of Fair, increased probability of Very Good  

Greater presence of Buddhism and Islam in Chinese prefectures is associated with **worse** self-rated health among older Chinese adults.  
- Buddhism: increased probability of Fair, decreased probability of Good/Very Good
- Islam: increased probability of Poor, decreased probability of Fair

## Conclusions

No evidence that the presence of religions in Chinese prefectures has matters differently for the health of religious adherents and non-adherents. 
  - For example, negative associations between Buddhist and Islam on the self-rated health are evident among both Buddhists and non-Buddhists.

## Limitations

Religious identity is a weak measure of the religious lives of Chinese individuals. 
- Only 8.5% report a religious identity (5.8% are Buddhist). 
- Better measures include level of belief and religious practice.

## Additional Analyses
Similar findings with other measures of health for older Chinese adults
  - Buddhism and Islam are associated with greater functional limitations, increased probability of experiencing body pain, and 
  - Daoism and Protestantism are associated with fewer functional limitations. 
  - Daoism is associated with few chronic illnesses and decreased probability of experiencing body pain. 

- Preliminary mediation analyses to test explanatory mechanisms and social pathways that link these associations suggest that perceived availability of social support is at least partially responsibile.

## Future Research

Develop a study with stronger measures of both structural and psycho-social of explanatory mechanisms. Include measures of social network
