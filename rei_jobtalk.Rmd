##.center[Research Questions]

### Study 2. How is the religious environment associated with the individual physical health outcomes of older Chinese adults?

- How is the overall presence of religion in Chinese prefectures associated with the physical health of older Chinese adults? 

- Or does the association vary by the presence of Buddhism, Catholicism, Daoism, Islam, and Protestantism?

- Does the association vary between adherents and non-adherents of each religion?

## Theoretical and Conceptual Framework

1. Conceptualization of religion as an ecological characteristic that influences individual and community-level outcomes.  

2. Socio-ecological framework that emphasizes features of the social environment as determinants of health (i.e.,  neighborhood/place effects on health)  

3. Mechanisms that link religion and health.

## Data & Measures

**.large[Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS)]**
- *N* = 21,057 Chinese residents aged 45+ in 12,450 households from 450 different neighborhoods (villages/urban communities), Wave 3 in 2015
- Analysis Sample: *n* = 6,948, aged 60+, respondents and spouses  

**Dependent Variable(s):** self-rated health (poor, fair, good, very good)<sup>1</sup>  

**Control variables**: individual demographics & religious identity, household characteristics, community characteristics (from 2014 Life History & 2011 Wave 1 Community survey)

## Models
**.large[Multi-level Multinomial Logistic Regression]**
- Four ordered categories of self-rated health (poor, fair, good, very good), but violation of parallel regression assumption (i.e., ordered relationship between IVs and DV). 
- Random intercept models with 4 levels of data (prefecture, community, household, individual)
  - Likelihood-ratio tests indicate that four-level models fit better than three-level and two-level models. 
  - Account for the nested/clustered structure of the data.

.large[**Variation by Individual Religion**]

Are associations between the religious environment and self-rated health different between religious adherents and non-adherents?

- Cross-level interactions between number of religious sites (prefecture) and religious identity (individual). 
  - e.g., number of total religious sites in prefectures X religious adherent/non-adherent
  - e.g., number of Buddhist temples in prefectures X Buddhists/non-Buddhists.
- None of these interactions are statistically significant; none of changes in the probabilities of being in each category of self-rated health are different by religious identity.

## Conclusions

No evidence that greater presence of overall religion in Chinese prefectures is associated with self-rated health among older Chinese adults.

Greater presence of Daoism and Protestantism in Chinese prefectures is associated with **better** self-rated health among older Chinese adults. 

Greater presence of Buddhism and Islam in Chinese prefectures is associated with **worse** self-rated health among older Chinese adults.  

No evidence that the presence of religions in Chinese prefectures has matters differently for the health of religious adherents and non-adherents.

## Limitations

Religious identity is a weak measure of the religious lives of Chinese individuals. 
- Only available religion measures in CHARLS. 
- Only 8.5% report a religious identity (5.8% are Buddhist). 
- Better measures include level of belief and religious practice.

Self-rated health is a very subjective measure. The religious environment may impact ratings of health more than health itself.

<br>
## Additional Analyses
Similar findings with other measures of health for older Chinese adults. 
  - Buddhism and Islam are associated with greater functional limitations, increased probability of experiencing body pain, and 
  - Daoism and Protestantism are associated with fewer functional limitations. 
  - Daoism is associated with few chronic illnesses and decreased probability of experiencing body pain. 

Preliminary mediation analyses to test explanatory mechanisms and social pathways suggest that perceived availability of social support and depressive symptoms in older adults at least partially account for some of these associations.

## Future Research

Develop a study with stronger measures of both structural and psycho-social of explanatory mechanisms. Include measures of social network
