Hi everyone, thanks so much for having me. I'm really excited to be here and to share some of my research with you. Today, I'll be speaking about the impact of the religious environment on population health in China. In particular, I'll be examining how the religious make-up of local areas impacts health outcomes among the older Chinese adults that live in them. Using geographic data of religious sites and national health and retirement survey of older adults, I will show that the presence of different religious groups in local areas has important health implications not only for people who are religious but also for people who are not. And from these findings, I argue that the religious environments in which people live not only matter for their individual health but also contribute to the geographic health disparities in mainland China.

Over the past 40 years, China's economic development has been incredible, so from that standpoint, it's surprising that the mortality rate in China is expected to double in the next few decades. By 2060, the mortality rate is projected to be about 14 deaths per thousand people each year. Today, the current rate is about 7 deaths per thousand people (slide graph of projections). This is a major concern for China. Since the late 1970s, the mortality in China has been between 6 and 7, so why is mortality expected to steadily increase over the next several years? Well, one major reason is that China's population is aging very rapidly. Because of it's one-child policy, which between 1979 and 2015 limited urban families to having only one child, more and more of China's population will be in these older age groups.

By 2050, the number of people aged 60 or older is also projected to double, actually a bit more than double, and increase from about 16 percent to about 35 percent of the total population [@unitednations2017, p. 28]. This population shift will also come with an increase in chronic health problems, specifically ones that disproportionately burden older adults [@chatterji2008; @fang2015].

This aging of the population and the expected increases in chronic health issues contribute to another problem: geographic health disparities. Rates of disease and mortality are not evenly distribution across China. The health gap between urban and rural areas and across regions, are a serious problem in China [@fang2010; @liu2019] and the aging of the Chinese population will exacerbate these inequalities. Differences in economic development, health insurance systems, and health care resources are among the major causes of these health inequalities [@fang2010; @liu2019], but there is a lot we don't know about how the environments that people live in affect their health. Understanding factors —both individual-level factors and community-level factors— that are associated with *who* gets sick and *where* they get sick can help reduce these disparities in health, they can help identify opportunities for disease prevention, and can help determine where more healthcare resources need to be distributed.

Although recent health research has shown that the places where people live, work, and play matter more for their health than their genes and biology, studies examining the effects of place on health neglect a key aspect of local geographic areas: the religious environment. Sociology’s classical tradition understood religion as a social phenomenon (Durkheim 2005; Weber 2013), but most health research today has predominately reduced religion to an individual-level attribute. A few scholars have begun to demonstrate that the demographic presence and socio-cultural influence of religion(s) in local geographic areas affect population health and mortality in the U.S. (Blanchard et al. 2008; Garcia, Bartkowski, and Xu 2017; Stroope and Baker 2018), but we know little about how this plays out in other social, political, and cultural contexts.

My work extends to this research to mainland China, which has a particularly fascinating set of characteristics that make it an


Make one basic point supported with theory and evidence.

To examine how the religious environment impacts population health and mortality in China, my dissertation sets how to answer 3 questions....

My dissertation project starts out by examining how the religious environment of Chinese counties impacts county mortality rates?

# Approach
## Theoretical Discipline Framework

Just as there is geographic variation in health and mortality across China, there is also geographic variation in religion.


## Methodology


To answer this question, I have constructed a dataset by merging geographic data of religious sites from the Online Spiritual Atlas of China with survey data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study or CHARLS (China’s version of the HRS). These two datasets are linked by prefecture identifiers called the GB code

To measure the religious environment, I use data from the Online Spiritual Atlas of China. a standardized count of religious sites for each religion in each of the 87 prefectures represented in the CHARLS survey. For example, in each of China’s prefectures (which are administrative subdivisions of Chinese provinces), I calculate the number of Buddhist temples per 10k people. I do this for all of China’s 5 officially recognized religions: Buddhism, Catholicism, Daoism, Islam, and Protestantism. So this is my focal independent variable.

The CHARLS survey has a variety of health measures, but here I use self-rated health as my primary dependent variable. This measure of self-rated health as 4 ordered categories (poor, fair, good, very good).

I have also selected a variety of control variables both at the individual and groups levels that I think are important factors to account for in the relationship between the religious environment and health.

As you can see here, these data are nested. There’s a multi-level structure to it. There are prefectures at the highest level. This is where I am measuring the religious environment. The CHARLS survey sampled individuals in specific communities for which they also collected community-level data. In addition, the CHARLs study also surveyed individual respondents AND their spouses, so there is a household level to this data as well. That’s 4 levels, about 6000 individuals from 3700 households in 175 communities in 87 prefectures.

### Full Model Graph

This graph shows the predicted probabilities of being in each category of self-rated health across the range of the number of religious sites in Chinese prefectures. The first graph represents the association between the total number of all religious sites and the categories of self-rated health, and all of the other graphs represent the association between the number sites for each religion and the categories of self-rated health. The lightest color shade is each graph is poor health and the darkest is very good health.

From the first graph, you'll notice that an increase in the total number of religious sites in Chinese prefectures has no effect on the probability of reporting each category of self-rated health. As the number of religious sites increases, there is little to not change in the probabilities of reporting each level of self-rated health.

In terms of the effects of each religion on self-rated health, my model predicts that as the presence of Buddhist increases in a prefecture, respondents will have an increased probability of reporting fair and poor health and decreased probabilities of reporting Good and Very Good health. So, the overall takeaway for Buddhism is that it is associated with worse health outcomes.

For an increased presence of Catholicism, the probability of reporting Good health declines. Although it looks like there might be an increase in the probability of reporting Very good health for an increase in Catholicism, the tests of significance don't show that this effect is any different from zero, so it's not clear whether this represents an overall positive or negative association between Catholicism and self-rated health.

An increase in Daoism is associated with a lower probability of reporting Poor health and a higher probability of reporting Good health, suggests that the increased presence of Daoism in Chinese prefectures is associated with better self-rated health.

For Islam, more mosques in a prefecture is associated with higher probabilities of reporting poor health and lower probabilities of reporting fair health. This is indicative of an overall negative association between Islam and health outcomes. The tests for the apparent increase in the probability of reporting very good are not significant.

And finally, an increase in the presence of Protestantism is associated with a decreased probability of reported Fair health and an increased probability of reporting very good health, which suggests an overall positive effect of Protestantism on self-rated health.
