Hi everyone, thanks so much for having me. I'm really excited to be here and to share some of my research with you. Today, I'll be speaking about the impact of the religious environment on population health in China. In particular, I'll be examining how the religious make-up of local areas impacts health outcomes among the older Chinese adults that live in them. Using geographic data of religious sites and national health and retirement survey of older adults, I will show that the presence of different religious groups in local areas has important health implications not only for people who are religious but also for people who are not. And from these findings, I argue that the religious environments in which people live not only matter for their individual health but also contribute to the geographic health disparities in mainland China.

Over the past 40 years, China's economic development has incredible, so from that standpoint, it's surprising that the mortality rate in China is expected to double in the next few decades. By 2060, the mortality rate is projected to be about 14 deaths per thousand people each year. Today, the current rate is about 7 deaths per thousand people (slide graph of projections). This is a major concern for China. Since the late 1970s, the mortality in China has been between 6 and 7, so why is mortality expected to steadily increase over the next several years? Well, one major reason is that China's population is aging very rapidly. Because of it's one-child policy, which between 1979 and 2015 limited urban families to having only one child, more and more of China's population will be in older age groups.

By 2050, the number of people aged 60 or older is also projected to increase from about 16 percent to about 35 percent of the total population [@unitednations2017, p. 28]. This population shift will be accompanied by an increase in chronic health problems, specifically ones that disproportionately burden older adults [@chatterji2008; @fang2015].

The aging of the population and the increase in chronic health issue will also exacerbate current geographic health disparities. Rates of disease and mortality are not evenly distribution across China. The health gap between urban and rural areas and across regions, are a serious problem in China [@fang2010; @liu2019]. Differences in economic development, health insurance systems, and health care resources are among the major causes of these health inequalities [@fang2010; @liu2019], but there is a lot we don't know about how the environments that people live in affect their health. Understanding factors —both individual-level factors and community-level factors— that are associated with *who* gets sick and *where* they get sick can help reduce the disparities in health, can help identify opportunities for disease prevention, and can help determine where more healthcare resources need to be distributed.

Although recent health research has shown that the places where people live, work, and play matter more for their health than their genes and biology, studies examining the effects of place on health neglect a key aspect of local geographic areas: the religious environment. Sociology’s classical tradition understood religion as a social phenomenon (Durkheim 2005; Weber 2013), but most health research today has predominately reduced religion to an individual-level attribute. A few scholars have begun to demonstrate that the demographic presence and socio-cultural influence of religion(s) in local geographic areas affect population health and mortality in the U.S. (Blanchard et al. 2008; Garcia, Bartkowski, and Xu 2017; Stroope and Baker 2018), but we know little about how this plays out in other social, political, and cultural contexts.

My work extends to this research to mainland China, which has a particularly fascinating set of characteristics that make it an


Make one basic point supported with theory and evidence.

To examine how the religious environment impacts population health and mortality in China, my dissertation sets how to answer 3 questions....

My dissertation project starts out by examining how the religious environment of Chinese counties impacts county mortality rates?
