## Introduction

Hi everyone, thanks so much for having me. I'm really excited to be here and to share some of my research with you. Today, I'll be speaking about the impact of the religious environment on population health in China. In particular, I'll be examining how the religious make-up of local areas impacts health outcomes among the older Chinese adults that live in them. Using geographic data of religious sites and national health and retirement survey of older adults, I will show that the presence of different religious groups in local areas has important health implications not only for people who are religious but also for people who are not. And from these findings, I argue that the religious environments in which people live not only matter for their individual health but also contribute to the geographic health disparities in mainland China.

Geographic health disparities, then exacerbated by aging of the population...


Over the past 40 years, China's economic development has been incredible. And although the health of many Chinese citizens has improved greatly, there are also widening health inequalities in China today. Much of this health disparity is observed between socioeconomic groups, but a lot of it is geographic. Rates of disease and mortality are not evenly distributed across China which you can see on this map. The health gap between urban and rural areas and across regions, are a serious problem in China [@fang2010; @liu2019].

And this problem is only going to be exacerbated by the rapid aging of the Chinese population. Because China's one-child policy, which between 1979 and 2015, limited urban families to having only one child, the growth of the Chinese population has slowed. As younger generations had fewer children than older generations. A consequence is that, as time passes, more and more of China's population will be in older age groups. By the year 2050, the number of people aged 60 or older is projected to more than double—to increase from about 16 percent to about 35 percent of the total population [@unitednations2017, p. 28]. So on this graph, notice how more of the population shifts into the darker green bars which represent age categories above age 60.

Now, this population shift will also come with an increase in chronic health problems, specifically ones that disproportionately burden older adults [@chatterji2008; @fang2015]. And in this way, the present health inequalities will continue to widen.

Of course research has shown that area differences in economic development, health insurance systems, and health care resources are some of the major causes of these health disparities [@fang2010; @liu2019], but there is still a lot we don't know about how the environments that people live in affect their health. Understanding factors —both individual-level factors and community-level factors— that are associated with *who* gets sick and *where*  can help reduce these disparities in health, they can help identify opportunities for disease prevention, and can they can help determine where more healthcare resources need to be distributed.

We now know that the places where people live, work, and play matter more for their health than their genes and biology, but studies examining the effects of place on health have neglected a key aspect of local geographic areas and communities: the religious environment. Sociology’s classical tradition understood religion as a profoundly social phenomenon (Durkheim 2005; Weber 2013), but most health research today has predominantly reduced religion to an individual-level attribute. Only a few scholars have studied how the religious environment affects population health and mortality in the U.S. (Blanchard et al. 2008; Garcia, Bartkowski, and Xu 2017; Stroope and Baker 2018), and we know very little about how this plays out in other social, political, and cultural contexts.

So, my work extends to this research to mainland China, which has a particularly fascinating set of characteristics that make it an ideal context for examining this question. In addition to the geographic health inequalities  I've just highlighted, China is also one of the most religiously diverse societies in the world. And across China, there are communities with very different religious makeups. On this map, I've shown the predominant religion in each Chinese prefecture. In the southwest and in central China, Buddhism is the most prevalent religion whereas in the northwest, Islam is. And in prefectures in the northeast, Protestant Christianity is really prominent.

Just as there is geographic variation in health and mortality across China, there is also geographic variation in religion. And connecting the variation in local health outcomes with the variation in local religious environments is what my dissertation project is all about. It sets out to examine whether and how the religious characteristics of local geographic areas is associated with health and mortality of the people living in them.

Today, I'll be presenting only one of the studies from my dissertation, but here's a quick overview of the entire project.

In the first study, I examine how the religious environment in Chinese counties is associated with county-level mortality rates.

In the second study, which I'll be sharing more about today, I examine how the religious environment in Chinese prefectures is associated with the individual physical health outcomes of older Chinese adults?

And in the final study, I examine potential mechanisms that explain these associations?

Again, what I want to do today, is share about my work on the second study. In the second study, there are 3 guiding research questions that I aimed to answer.

The first is whether the overall presence of religion affected health outcomes? So do more religious areas have different health outcomes than less religious areas?

The second is whether each religion has its own separate effect on health outcomes? So is there a difference in how each religion is associated with health outcomes.

And finally, are the connections between the religious environment and health outcomes different for religious people than for non-religious? For example, does the presence of Buddhism in an area matter differently for the health of Buddhists than for non-Buddhists?


# Approach
## Theoretical Discipline Framework

To try to understand and explain the potential health consequences of religious ecology in the Chinese context, I draw on theoretical and conceptual frameworks from social epidemiology, sociology of religion, and prior studies of religion and health.

First, I conceptualize religion as characteristic of a place. Most studies of religion and health routinely conceptualize and measure religion as an individual-level attribute, but religion is not only something that individuals believe, practice, or identify with; it is also a "group property" [@stark1996] with "an essentially social character" [@idler2014a, 3]. It is a profoundly social phenomenon that is socially produced [@berger1967], socially reinforced [@cornwall1989], and socially transmitted in social environments such as congregations [@stroope2011], families [@bengtson2013; @smith2005], and social networks [@cheadle2012; @lofland1965; @stark1980]. So religion is a social force that has the potential to shape both individual and community health.

This argument isn't new though. Early sociologists like Weber [-@weber2013] and Durkheim [-@durkheim2005] understood religion to be a very important community-level characteristic. So to emphasize this, I use the term "religious environment" to describe the demographic presence and socio-cultural influence of religion(s) in a local social environment (Blanchard et al. 2008: 1595)—most commonly a geographic area. This helps distinguish between religion’s individual and contextual effects, which the different being between an individual's religion affecting their health vs. their community's religion affecting their health.

So what does a religious environment look like? How do we capture what the religious environment of local area is? Most commonly, scholars have used the religious composition of an area, the religious make-up of an area, to define the religious environment, so what religions are present and to what degree. Usually, this is operationalized as the number of adherents or followers of different religions.


First, I draw on insights from the social determinants of health literature and more specifically, the work that examines the effects of place on health. In this US, the research on how neighborhoods and communities impact health outcomes has shown us that population patterns of health and disease are “biological expressions of social relations.” This kind of work, like this conceptual model, uses an socio-ecological framework, which emphasizes the multiple levels and domains of the social and ecological environment that influence health outcomes (Krieger 2001). We now know that socio-cultural characteristics of local areas are important categories of features that help explain area differences in health (Macintyre and Ellaway 2000: 342-343). Religion is one of these, but it is rarely considered in social epidemiology. In this particular model of place effects on health, culture is included as macro-level socio-structural conditions and examples like norms and values and social cohesion are given. What about religion here? It's missing here from this model, but things like norms and values and social cohesion are certainly impacted by religion.

If we conceptualize religion as an upstream socio-cultural feature of a place, this model helpful for theorizing about how it shaping social network structures and ties which provide opportunities for




In other conceptual models, such as this one that outlines the

And when religion is included in research on health, it is often conceptualized as an individual-level attribute.



Several contemporary theoretical conceptualizations have emerged to explain how the religious environment affects individual- and community-level outcomes. First, the moral community hypothesis argues that religion fosters a moral environment that integrates individuals and regulates behavior within a community (Stark 1996). The religious composition of a community may either directly influence the attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes of all community members but may also interact with individual-level religiosity, such that the effect of religion is greatest for highly religious individuals in highly religious social environments (Stark 1996; Regnerus 2003; Stroope and Baker 2018). Another model argues that local religious subcultures—the attitudes, values, beliefs, and practices shared by members of a common religious group—not only influence members of a religious group but can also have indirect influences on non-members in the same community via influences on local public subcultures (Olson 2019). In this model, larger religious groups shape the attitudes and behaviors of others through their greater presence in interpersonal social networks (Olson 2019).

These conceptualizations of religion’s contextual effects emphasize the dynamic role of social connections, which also feature prominently in social epidemiological models of disease and health distribution. For example, Berkman et al. (2000) center the role of social networks in a causal process that links upstream forces like social, cultural, economic, and political conditions with downstream mediating mechanisms and pathways that influence individual health. In this model, 1) macro-level social-structural conditions determine the structure and characteristics of social networks, which provide opportunities for social support, social influence, social participation/engagement, and access to resources. These mechanisms then influence health through pathways such as physiological responses to stress, psychological states, health behaviors, and exposure to infectious disease (Berkman et al. 2000: 846). For this project, I conceptualize religion as a macro-level social-structural condition that affects social networks and subsequently mechanisms and pathways that impact health outcomes. This is consistent with prior studies of religion which demonstrate that 1) health and lifestyle behaviors; 2) social resources; 3) coping; and 4) attitudes, beliefs, emotional states, and feelings help explain the robust associations between individual religious involvement and health (Chatters 2000; Ellison and Levin 1998; George, Ellison, and Larson 2002).

Research indicates that religious involvement decreases mortality risks (Kim, Smith, and Kang 2015; Krause 2006; Sullivan 2010) and positively influences the physical health and psychological well-being of individuals across the life course (Cotton et al. 2006; Koenig 2009, 2015; Powell, Shahabi, and Thoresen 2003). Only a few published studies, however, have investigated how the religious environment affects health. Blanchard et al. (2008) showed that higher concentrations of Fundamentalist and Pentecostal Protestant congregations in the U.S. is associated with higher all-cause mortality rates. Studies of infant mortality find similar variation across denominations (Bartkowski, Xu, and Garcia 2011; Garcia, Bartkowski, and Xu 2017). Differences in theological orientations may explain these varying effects on population health (Bartkowski, Xu, and Garcia 2011; Blanchard et al. 2008). Evidence also suggests that individual-level religiosity interacts with the religious environment at the county (Stroope and Baker 2018) and national levels (Diener, Tay, and Myers 2011; Elliott and Hayward 2009) to affect individual health. These associations also vary by level of government restrictions on religion (Hayward and Elliott 2014) and between religious majority and minority groups (May and Smilde 2016).






## Methodology


To answer this question, I have constructed a dataset by merging geographic data of religious sites in China with a national health and retirement study.

To measure the religious environment, I use data from the Online Spiritual Atlas of China. This data was collected as part of China's 2004 Economic Census, and was clean and published by Purdue's Center on Religion and the Global East, which I have worked with for the past 5 years. This dataset has information for over 72,000 religious sites in China.

Most commonly, number of followers or adherents is used, but that information has been notoriously difficult to obtain in China. So instead, I used the number of religious sites to capture how prominent a religion is in an area. And in this study, I use a standardized count of religious sites for each religion. So for example, in each of China’s prefectures (which are administrative subdivisions of Chinese provinces, smaller than province, but larger than a county), I calculate the number of Buddhist temples per 100k people. I do this for all of China’s 5 officially recognized religions: Buddhism, Catholicism, Daoism, Islam, and Protestantism and I also count the total number of religious sites to get an overall measure of how strong the presence of religion is in an area. So this is my focal independent variable and represents the religious environment.

As an example, on this map, I've plotted the religious sites for the prefectures in Guangdong province. So we can see how the distribution of religious sites varies quite a bit across prefectures. In some prefectures there are dozens of sites and in others there are only a few.

To measure health in China, I use survey items from the the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). This is a nationally representative health survey of Chinese residents age 45 and older. The survey has a variety of health measures, but here today, I'll just be presenting my findings for self-rated health as my primary dependent variable. But I have also used measures for chronic illness, functional limitations, and body pain to capture the health status of older Chinese adults.

I have also selected a variety of control variables both at the individual and groups levels that I think are important factors to account for in the relationship between the religious environment and health.

As you can see here, these data are clearly nested. There’s a multi-level structure to it. There are prefectures at the highest level. This is where I am measuring the religious environment. The CHARLS survey sampled individuals in specific communities for which they also collected community-level data. In addition, the CHARLs study also surveyed individual respondents AND their spouses, so there is a household level to this data as well. That’s 4 levels, about 6000 individuals from 3700 households in 175 communities in 87 prefectures.

The first of the research questions I set out to answer with this study is how the overall religious environment impacts the physical health of older Chinese adults. So do areas with a stronger religious presence have different health outcomes than areas with a weaker religious presence? That's the first question we're asking here.

This graph shows the predicted probabilities of being in each category of self-rated health from a multi-level multinomial logistic regression model with the total number of religious sites in Chinese prefectures as focal independent variable.

The predictions from this model suggest that the overall religious environment of religious does NOT affect individuals' self-rated health. Notice that the predicted probability of respondents' reporting each level of self-rated health does not significantly change as the total number of religious sites increases. the lines are more or less flat. So for example, as the number of religious sites in a prefecture increases, the predicted probabilities of reporting GOOD and VERY GOOD health stays about .1 for each. It does appear that the probability of reporting FAIR health is decreasing and the probability of reporting POOR health is increasing, but the tests on these indicate that the average change across the range of religious sites is not different from zero.

So again, a greater presence of religion (of any kind of religion) is not associated with the self-rated health of older Chinese adults.

This means that if there is a connection between the religious environment and health, then its religion specific. And that's what my second research question for this study examines: whether associations between the religious environment and self-rated health vary by religious group. So does each religion have a different effect on self-rated health?


### Full Model Graph

This graph shows the predicted probabilities of being in each category of self-rated health across the range of the number of religious sites in Chinese prefectures. The first graph in the upper left is the same graph we just saw. I just included it for comparison. All of the other graphs represent the association between the number sites for each religion and the categories of self-rated health. The lightest color shade is each graph is poor health and the darkest is very good health.

Again, in the first graph, the total number of religious sites in Chinese prefectures has no effect on the probability of reporting each category of self-rated health. There is little to no change in the probabilities of reporting each level of self-rated health as the total number of sites increases.

In terms of the effects of each religion on self-rated health, the graphs from this model shows that different religious groups have different associations between their presence in Chinese prefectures and the self-rated health of older adults living there.

The top-line takeaway here is that the presence of Buddhism and Islam have an overall negative association with self-rated health, and the presence of Daoism and Protestantism have an overall positive association with self-rated health. So as the number of Buddhist temples and Islamic mosques increase across Chinese prefectures, older Chinese adults report worse self-rated health, and as the number of Daoist temples and Protestant churches increases across Chinese prefectures, older Chinese adults report better health.

Let's zoom in Buddhism as a quick example. An increase in the presence of Buddhism in Chinese prefectures is associated with a lower probability of reporting Good and Very Good health and a higher probability of reporting Fair health. If we compare the lines for Good and Very Good to the line for Fair, we see that people are moving out of the Good and Very Good health categories and into the Fair health category. So this is a net negative effect for Buddhism on self-rated health, because the probabilities for reporting better health categories decreases while the probabilities for reporting worse health categories increases.

Looking at the Fair line again for Buddhism, the probability of reporting Fair health in prefectures with no Buddhist temples is predicted to be about .5, whereas the probability of reporting Fair health in prefectures with the most number of Buddhist temples in the data set is .630. That's a jump of 13 percentage points across the range of Buddhist temples.

Similarly, the probability of reporting Very Good health in prefectures with no Buddhist temples is predicted to be about .13, and the probability of reporting Very Good health in prefectures with the most number of Buddhist temples in the data set is .025. That's a drop of more than 10 percentage points across the range of the data. So as the number of Buddhist temples increases across prefectures, respondents are increasingly more likely to report Fair health and increasingly less likely to report Good and Very Good health.

I'll show  statistical tests in a moment, but there's a lot to interpret from these models, and I think the graphs are most helpful for seeing the patterns.

We don't have time to zoom in on each of the religions in much detail, but I will point out the patterns that are evident for each.

For Catholicism, the only statistically significant change for more Catholic churches is a lower probability of Good health, but it's not clear which categories they are actually moving too. It looks like there might be an increase in the probability of reporting Very good health, but the statistical tests on this show that this effect is not any different from zero, so it's not clear whether this change out of the Good category represents an overall positive or negative association between Catholicism and self-rated health.

For Daoism, an increase in the presence of Daoism is associated with a lower probability of reporting Poor health and a higher probability of reporting Good health. People are moving out of the Poor health category and into the Good health category, a net positive effect of Daoism on self-rated health.

For Islam, an increased presence of Islam in Chinese prefectures is associated with a lower probability of reporting Fair health and a higher probability of reporting Poor health. So here, people are moving out of the Fair health category into a worse category, the Poor health category, which is a net negative effect on self-rated health for Islam.

And finally, for Protestantism, more Protestant churches in prefectures is associated with lower probability of reporting Faith health, and a higher probability of reporting Very Good health, again a net positive effect. People are moving out of Fair health and into Very Good health.

So again, these results indicate that the presence of Buddhism and Islam have an overall negative association with self-rated health, and the presence of Daoism and Protestantism have an overall positive association with self-rated health.

The graphs are helpful for visualizing the models, but to test the change in the probabilities as the number of religious sites increases, I use average marginal effects. What an average marginal effect represents here is the average change in the probabilities of reporting each category of self-rated health for a standard deviation increase in the number of religious sites. And since these results come from multinomial models, there is an AME for each category of elf rated health.

So back to Buddhism as my example. In this table, I show the average marginal effects of a SD increase in the number of Buddhist temples. The statistical test here is whether the value is significantly different from zero.

On average, for a SD increase in Buddhist temples, there is:
- no change in probability of reporting **poor** health (that value is not statistically different from zero),
- a .028 *increase* in probability of reporting **fair** health,
- a .013 *decrease* in probability of reporting **good** health, and
- a .025 *increase* in probability of reporting **very good** health.]]

So, again we see where the probability shifts from Very Good towards Fair, indicating an overall negative effect of the presence of Buddhism in Chinese prefectures on the self-rated of older adults.

In this table, I summarize the average marginal effects of the overall presence of religion—the total sites columns—and the average marginal effects of each religion on the probabilities of reporting each category of self-rated health. These all represent the average change in the probabilities for a SD deviation increase in the number of religious sites. From this table, we draw the same conclusions from the average marginal effects that we do from the graphs, but these provide the statistical tests to confirm the patterns we saw.

So, there are no statistically significant effects for total sites in the first column. We see that a greater presence of Buddhism (which we just looked at) and Islam is associated with a decrease in the probabilities in better health categories and an increase in the probabilities in worse health categories. And a greater presence of Daoism and Protestantism is associated with a decrease in probabilities of worse health categories and an increase in probabilities of better health categories. And again the effects for Catholicism aren't conclusive.

# Interactions

The last research question that I set out to answer in this study is whether these associations are different between adherents and non-adherents.

To get at this question, I ran additional models with all of the same variables but I included with cross-level interaction terms between the number of sites for each religion in prefectures and the religious identities of the individual respondents. This approach allows me to test for example whether the effect of the presence of Buddhism in Chinese prefectures is different for Buddhists than for non-Buddhists. First, I do this with the total number of religious sites, and then I do it for each religion. In short, these models show no evidence that the effects that I've just been sharing about are different by the religious identity of individuals. This suggests that the effect of the religious environment on self-rated health is no different for religious adherents than it is for non-adherents. And I find this to be the case for my


# Conclusion

No evidence that greater presence of overall religion in Chinese prefectures is associated with self-rated health among older Chinese adults.
  - Suggests there is not an overall effect of the "religious" environment.




## Limitations
Finally, I want to mention a few limitations to what I've presented here as well as a few ways that I think future research could build on these findings. First, religious identity is a relatively weak measure of the religious lives of Chinese individuals. Far more people believe and practice religion than identify with religion. And many people actually believe and practice more than one religion. So a religious identity question on a survey in China is only capturing a small skewed part of individual religion. This is the only available question in the CHARLS survey and only 8.5% report a religious identity (5.8% are Buddhist). Some better would be level of belief and religious practice.

Self-rated health is a very subjective measure. The religious environment may impact ratings of health more than health itself.
